Everything works in this project as needed in the project specifications.

The only difference, is my worm starts with the head on the left hand side instead
of on the right.


The worm moves in the following way:
h: LEFT
j: DOWN
k: UP
l: RIGHT


The worm is initialized with a head and 7 body segments in the center of the screen.

Hitting yourself (the worm) or the border will cause the game to end.

The score is the combined value of 'munchies' that are picked up by moving on top of them.
