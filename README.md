# Worm Game

This game was [designed as a project](https://github.com/keegandonley/Snake-Game/blob/master/README.txt) for my data structures class.

It utilizes an inverted list and a circular buffer to run a worm game in constant time with respect to the current length of the worm.

Movement is using the keys a,s,d,w.

Run the game using `make run`

After `make`, the game can be run with custom dimensions by using `./worm.x <num_rows> <num_columns>`
